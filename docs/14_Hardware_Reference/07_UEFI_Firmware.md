<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> Some wireless or mechanical keyboards that doesn't respect the standard USB HID protocol could doesn't work in the UEFI BIOS Firmware menu. Regarding the wireless keyboards we tested these that are proper working also in the UEFI BIOS menu: [Logitech k400r](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/wireless-touch-keyboard-k400r), [Logitech k400 plus](http://www.logitech.com/product/wireless-touch-keyboard-k400-plus), [Microsoft All-in-One Media Keyboard](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/products/keyboards/all-in-one-media-keyboard/n9z-00013).

  Warning: Please do NOT "play" with the SCU menu choices if you don't know what you are doing.

## Restore Factory configuration

You can restore the factory default settings from the SCU pressing the **F9** key.

You can also restore the factory UEFI BIOS configuration with a simple procedure involving the RTC battery: when the board is NOT connected to any power source, **unplug the RTC battery** on the bottom side of the board and keep it unplugged for **at least 1 minute**. Plug the RTC battery again and power up the board, all the configurations should now be reverted to the factory defaults.

Updating the UEFI BIOS to a newer version will also restore the new factory default configuration.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> You can use the RTC battery procedure starting from the **UEFI BIOS v1.03** so check to have your UDOO X86 [updated](!/Advanced_Topics/UEFI_update).

If you cannot use the precedents methods take a look at this useful [threads of Jetguy](https://www.udoo.org/forum/threads/reset-bios-jumper-or-pins.6674/) in the UDOO Forum.
